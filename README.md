# derby-data

The **OnTrack** Java app in this repo was an attempt to make data acquisition in [Roller Derby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_derby) bout situations more effective. A user can record game events visually by moving skater icons around -- each on track event is persisted in an event log that could be used to reconstruct the game for e.g. analysis, stats book completion etc.
